OpenPyxl is a Python library to read/write Excel 2007 xlsx/xlsm files.

It was born from lack of existing library to read/write natively from Python the new Open Office XML format.

All kudos to the PHPExcel team as openpyxl is a Python port of PHPExcel http://www.phpexcel.net/

== User List ==
Official user list can be found on http://groups.google.com/group/openpyxl-users

== Contribute ==
Any help will be greatly appreciated, there are just a few requirements to get your code checked in the public repository:
* Mercurial bundles are the preferred way of contributing code, compared to diffs written in a text file. Forks are encouraged, but don't forget to make a pull request if you want your code to be included :)
* long diffs posted in the body of a tracker request will not be looked at (more than 30 rows of non-syntax highlighted code is simply unreadable). Please attach your bundle files to the issue instead.
* every non-trivial change must come with at least a unit test (that tests the new behavior, obviously :p). There are plenty of examples in the /test directory if you lack know-how or inspiration.

== Easy Install ==
Releases are also packaged on PyPi, so all you have to type to get the latest version is:

    $ easy_install openpyxl

        * Floats
        * Percentages
    * Optimized modes to read and write extremely large files

== Python 3.x support ==

Openpyxl supports python (even if some tests can fail on 2.4) from 2.4 to 3.2.

== Quick Examples ==

=== Write a workbook ===

    #!python
    from openpyxl.workbook import Workbook
    from openpyxl.writer.excel import ExcelWriter

    from openpyxl.cell import get_column_letter

    wb = Workbook()

    dest_filename = r'empty_book.xlsx'

    ws = wb.worksheets[0]

    ws.title = "range names"

    for col_idx in xrange(1, 40):
        col = get_column_letter(col_idx)
        for row in xrange(1, 600):
            ws.cell('%s%s'%(col, row)).value = '%s%s' % (col, row)

    ws = wb.create_sheet()

    ws.title = 'Pi'

    ws.cell('F5').value = 3.14

    wb.save(filename = dest_filename)

=== Read an existing workbook ===

    #!python
    from openpyxl.reader.excel import load_workbook

    wb = load_workbook(filename = r'empty_book.xlsx')

    sheet_ranges = wb.get_sheet_by_name(name = 'range names')

    print sheet_ranges.cell('D18').value # D18

=== Number Formats ===

    #!python
    import datetime
    from openpyxl.workbook import Workbook

    wb = Workbook()
    ws = wb.worksheets[0]

    # set date using a Python datetime
    ws.cell('A1').value = datetime.datetime(2010, 7, 21)

    print ws.cell('A1').style.number_format.format_code # returns 'yyyy-mm-dd'

    # set percentage using a string followed by the percent sign
    ws.cell('B1').value = '3.14%'

    print ws.cell('B1').value # returns 0.031400000000000004

    print ws.cell('B1').style.number_format.format_code # returns '0%'
