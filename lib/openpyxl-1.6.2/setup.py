"""Setup script for packaging openpyxl.

Requires setuptools.

To build the setuptools egg use
    python setup.py bdist_egg
and either upload it to the PyPI with:
    python setup.py upload
or upload to your own server and register the release with PyPI:
    python setup.py register

A source distribution (.zip) can be built with
    python setup.py sdist --format=zip

That uses the manifest.in file for data files rather than searching for
them here.
