Description: openpyxl
        ========
        
        openpyxl is a Python library to read/write Excel 2010 xlsx/xlsm files.
        
        It was born from lack of existing library to read/write natively from Python
        the new Office Open XML format.
        
        All kudos to the PHPExcel team as openpyxl is based on PHPExcel
